                        <strong>What is nanotechnology?</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Nanotechnology converts fat-soluble and poorly water-soluble compounds into highly water-soluble
                        particles. The process creates a clear aqueous solution of these compounds in high
                        concentrations. This results in very stable therapeutic preparations that greatly enhance the
                        compound's absorption and also the rate at which the compound is absorbed. This in particular
                        allows absorption across the oral mucosal lining as opposed to Intestinal absorption.

                    </h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Medlab has achieved a successful world first lodgment for a patent application pertaining to a
                        unique delivery system that converts such compounds into nanosized particles, certified to
                        measure less than 0.2 microns. Nano-formulations, by virtue of their size, are known for
                        circumventing the obstacles of poor pharmacokinetics. The resulting aqueous solubility of the
                        compound ensures its transport across the cellular membrane. This patented technology will be
                        applied to both nutritional and pharmaceutical compounds in the near future.

                        Our research demonstrates that nanotechnology increases plasma and serum levels of fat-soluble
                        nutrients up to 3 times more than emulsions and up to 5 times more than oil preparations in
                        healthy participants (Fig 1).

                        Furthermore, the absorption rate of the nanoparticles is 200% more than that of an emulsion
                        formulation and 370% more than an oil preparation (Fig 2).<sup>2</sup>

                        Nanoparticle, Emulsion or Tablet formulation in 10 healthy participants. The figure below
                        demonstrates the percentage increase of serum B12 at 1 hour, 3 hours and 6 hours compared to
                        baseline values. Medlabï¿½s B12 Nanoparticles significantly increased serum B12 levels compared
                        to either the Emulsion or Tablet formulations and maintained a higher serum B12 level at the
                        6 hour time point.

                        <strong>How NanoCelle works - differences to Emulsions</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Emulsions typically consist of at least 2 immiscible liquids (usually oil and water) with one
                        of the liquids being dispersed as small spherical droplets into the other. Emulsions are
                        thermodynamically unfavorable systems that tend to break down over time due to a variety of
                        physicochemical mechanisms including gravitational separation, flocculation, coalescence and
                        change of structure.<sup>3</sup> Conventional oil-in-water emulsions do not produce
                        water-soluble particles (Fig 3); they remain water-insoluble and thus still require efficient
                        processing by the body to create particles that are able to be absorbed across the mucosal e
                        pithelium of the small and large intestine. Our nanotechnology creates water-soluble aqueous
                        solutions (Fig 4).
