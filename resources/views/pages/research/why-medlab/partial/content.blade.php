                        At Medlab Clinical Ltd (Medlab), we believe we have the fundamentals to "create". Where innovative thinking thrives and research is valued.
                        We have created a culture that we are proud of.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Medlab has an outstanding research portfolio in early phase drug discovery across
                        obesity, chronic kidney disease, depression, muscular loss associated with ageing and non opioid
                        pain management.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our facility is an approved Office of the <a class="medlab_panel_content_link" href="http://www.ogtr.gov.au/">Gene Technology Regulator</a>
                        (OGTR), Physical Containment level-2 (PC2) biological laboratory, the main stage for our research focus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From our research portfolio, novel nutraceuticals are designed for specific clinical needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our core principles are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Research</li>
                        <li>Innovation</li>
                        <li>Clinical End Points</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This allows us to encapsulate the true meaning of translational research and focus on specific milestones to move from "bench" to "bedside."
