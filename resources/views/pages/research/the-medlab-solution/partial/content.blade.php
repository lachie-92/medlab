                        The processes of the body do not all work in isolation, and hence a holistic approach is needed
                        to optimise treatment for an individual patient. Sub optimal processes in one part of the body
                        have the potential to impact another part of the body. Environmental changes can also have an
                        impact. For example poor food choices have the potential to reduce the effectiveness of the gut
                        bacteria to digest food, and the dysfunction or "dysbiosis" of the gut is thought to
                        contribute to chronic diseases including diabetes and CKD.

                        Medlab is at the forefront of a new treatment paradigm which views the function of the gut as
                        central to many of the processes in the body and the starting point for many chronic diseases
                        that have nothing to do with the stomach. The gut and its chemical messengers have connections
                        to the brain for example. Metabolic processes such as glucose metabolism are affected by gut
                        bacteria. By improving the function of the gut, Medlab aims to modify the course of chronic
                        diseases.

                        Medicines utilising good bacteria, also known as probiotics, are under investigation in a number
                        of research programs around the world, but none are yet approved as Prescription Medicines for
                        early intervention to stop the progression of chronic diseases, under the supervision of a
                        doctor. This will require completion of rigorous clinical trials to demonstrate specific
                        health benefits. Probiotics are extremely well tolerated, which is an important attribute of
                        medicine for early intervention.

                        In the digital age, the empowered consumer is increasingly knowledgeable about their health and
                        is often willing to pay for treatments that maintain their health, and avoid potential side
                        effects of current drugs especially for chronic diseases.

                    <p>
                        An increasing focus of the "young elderly" on maintaining health extends to a desire
                        to avoid the effects of pain and aging. It is likely that many older people will be willing to
                        pay an amount similar to "a cup of coffee a day" for a proven medicine that will
                        enable them to feel younger, such as a treatment to reduce muscle aging. For this reason the
                        revenue growth is not reliant on re-imbursement from health payors.
