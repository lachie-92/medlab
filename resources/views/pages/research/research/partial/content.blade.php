                            moderate to severe depression with no evidence to support the use of antidepressants in mild depression. Depression is a large cause of disability
                            in Australia with minor depression reported to be 2-3 times more common than major depression. Furthermore, clinical research is predominantly
                            targeted towards major depression, excluding a large proportion of the population in need of effective treatment options. Medlab's research focus
                            is the development of novel drugs for the treatment of mild depressive symptoms.

                            <strong>PROVISONAL PATENT LODGED.</strong> Current treatment options for chronic pain relief include anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anti-depressant medications that are often
                            associated with numerous unwanted side effects limiting their dose and longevity of use. The cannabis plant contains over 70 unique cannabinoid
                            compounds that are responsible for its therapeutic and psychotomimetic/addictive effects. The main psychoactive component is tetrahydrocannabinol
                            (THC) that is predominantly responsible for the health and psychological effects associated with cannabis use. In recent years, considerable
                            research has been initiated in isolating and analyzing THC for the treatment of people suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDs, chronic pain and also for
                            epilepsy. Furthermore, Medlab hypothesizes that combining pharmaco-active cannabinoid analytes with biological therapies will amplify the therapeutic
                            effects.

                        The aim of the following clinical trials is to investigate and demonstrate that a novel,
                        patent-protected delivery system is superior to standard delivery systems for nutraceutical
                        therapies currently on the market e.g. capsules, liquids and powders. Bioavailability of
                        nutraceutical compounds can be reduced and/or tightly regulated when administered orally due to gastrointestinal physiology, dysfunction and inflammation and
                        also from gastrointestinal bacterial metabolism of the compounds. There is a need to improve the
                        delivery mechanism of nutraceutical compounds to achieve optimal bioavailability and therapeutic
                        efficacy. Medlab research staff, in collaboration with InMed researchers have developed a novel
