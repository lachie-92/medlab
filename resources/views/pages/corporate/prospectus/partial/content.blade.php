                        <strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The paper form of the electronic Prospectus accessible on this website is a replacement
                        Prospectus dated 4 June 2015 (<strong>Prospectus</strong>) and was lodged with the Australian
                        Securities and Investments Commission (<strong>ASIC</strong>) on that date.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The original prospectus dated 13 April 2015 was lodged with ASIC on that date. An application for
                        the Company's Shares to be admitted to the Official List of the ASX was made on 13 April
                        2015.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The prospectus is a replacement prospectus which entirely replaces the supplementary prospectus
                        dated 20 May 2015 and the replacement prospectus dated 20 April 2015 which entirely replaced the
                        prospectus dated 13 April 2015.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Neither ASIC nor ASX Limited, nor any of their officers, take any responsibility for the contents
                        of the Prospectus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Anyone who wants to acquire shares in the Company will need to carefully consider the Prospectus
                        and complete an application form that will be in, or will accompany, Prospectus. If you request
                        a Prospectus you are not obliged to apply for shares.
                    </p>

                        The Company is not liable for any loss incurred from relying on this site, including from data
                        corruption on download.

                    <p>
                        Applicants for securities will be required to complete an Application Form that accompanies the
                        Prospectus. The <em>Corporations Act 2001</em> (Cth) prohibits any person from passing on
                        to another person an application form unless it is attached to or accompanied by a complete and
                        unaltered version of a prospectus.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Company will not accept a completed Application Form if it has reason to believe that the
                        Applicant has not received a complete and unaltered copy of the Prospectus. A paper copy of the
                        Prospectus is available free of charge to any person in Australia by calling 1300 369 570.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Applications for Shares under the Offer must be made using the Prospectus Application Form
                        attached to or accompanying the Prospectus.

                    <p>
                        The Prospectus does not constitute an offer or an invitation in any jurisdiction in which, or to
                        any person to whom, it would not be lawful to make such an offer or invitation. The distribution
                        of the Prospectus in jurisdictions outside Australia may be restricted by law and persons who
                        come into possession of the Prospectus should seek advice on and observe any of these
                        restrictions. Failure to comply with these restrictions may violate securities laws.

                    <p>
                        Applicants who are resident in countries other than Australia should consult their professional
                        advisers as to whether any governmental or other consent are required or whether any other
                        formalities need to be considered and followed.

                        Nothing in this website constitutes an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy,
                        securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. The shares referred to herein have
                        not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (<strong>U.S.

                        the United States and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under
                        the U.S. Securities Act or an exemption from registration requirements.
