                        Perhaps the most studied site for investigating probiotic efficacy is the gastrointestinal tract
                        (GIT) and inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and irritable
                        bowel syndrome (IBS). Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or irritable bowel
                        syndrome (IBS) have been reported to present with increased pro-inflammatory or potentially pathogenic
                        bacterial species such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>,<sup>1,2</sup> members of the genus <em>Bacteroides</em><sup>3</sup>
                        and <em>Enterococci</em>; and decreased <em>Bifidobacteria</em> and <em>Lactobacilli</em> species.<sup>4,5</sup>
                        For example, the etiology of IBD is not fully understood, but is considered to be a T-cell-driven inflammatory
                        response resulting from a persistent preponderance of pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine production,<sup>6</sup>
                        whereas, Crohn's disease (CD) is reported to be driven by an T-helper 1 (TH1) immune response<sup>7,8</sup>
                        that can affect any part of the GIT, i.e., from the mouth to the anus. By contrast, UC is a T-helper 2 (Th2)
                        driven response, and is restricted to the mucosa of the colon and rectum.<sup>8,9</sup>

                        <strong>Role of Probiotics in Gastrointestinal Conditions</strong><br><br>
                        It has been reported that probiotic bacteria may operate on three levels of host functionality via
                        their metabolite production that enhances GIT and extra-intestinal activity namely by (a) interfering
                        with the growth of pathogenic bacteria in the lumen of the GIT; (b) strengthening gut epithelial barrier
                        function and mucosal immunity as well as mucus production; and (c) beyond the gut-brain, and heart.
                        A series of clinical trials reviewed elsewhere<sup>10,11</sup> that implemented various combinations of probiotic
                        species frequently demonstrated efficacy in treating GIT conditions/diseases and various other end-organ tissues.<sup>10,11</sup>
                        The core notion emanating from the reviews was the administration of multi-species probiotic formulations could,
                        in addition to improving GIT function, influence numerous end-organ tissues beneficially. Furthermore,
                        clinical studies indicate that administration of probiotic bacterial species provides efficacious results
                        in restoring the GIT microbiome to a more balanced metabolic state. This possibly achieved in part by
                        reducing pathogenic bacterial overgrowth and the resulting adverse localized effects that in turn affect end-organ physiology.

                        <strong>Role of Probiotics in IBD</strong><br><br>
                        Probiotics have been shown to reduce abdominal pain, discomfort, and symptom scores in patients with IBS when
                        administered <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>,<sup>12</sup> <em>Lactobacillus plantarum</em>,<sup>13</sup> or
                        ProSymbioflor (a combination of <em>E. coli</em> DSM and <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em>)<sup>14</sup> compared with
                        a placebo (see Table 1). In contrast, Drouault-Holowacz and colleagues<sup>15</sup> found that <em>Bifidobacterium longum</em>,
                        <em>L. acidophilus</em>, <em>Lactobacillus lacti</em> and <em>Streptococcus thermophilus</em> were not superior
                        to the placebo treatment for relieving disease symptoms except that of abdominal pain, due to a strong placebo effect.
                        Further analysis of the IBS subgroups revealed that patients with changing bowel habits (alternating between
                        constipation and diarrhea and those with short durations of symptom exacerbation and remission) reported significantly
                        less abdominal pain with constipation-predominant IBS patients reporting improved bowel motions. These results indicate
                        that different disease etiologies may exist between IBS subgroups and that some probiotics may be more efficient than
                        others for treating symptoms within these subgroups. These findings also point to the need to further classify patients
                        into relevant sub groups whenever possible for assessing the efficacy of a probiotic. <br>

                        <br>
                        A number of studies investigating the effects of probiotics within specific sub-groups of IBS have shown the beneficial
                        effects of probiotic supplements. Therefore, Zeng and colleagues<sup>16</sup> first separated patients with IBS into
                        sub groups (those with increased small bowel permeability and those with increased colonic permeability), treating
                        diarrhea-predominant IBS patients with <em>S. thermophilus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</em>, <em>Lactobacillus bulgaricus</em>
                        and <em>B. longum</em>. The proportion of patients with increased small bowel permeability (lactulose/mannitol ratio >0.025)
                        decreased significantly (p < 0.023) after treatment. These patients also demonstrated improved IBS scores with diminished
                        abdominal pain and flatulence. Similarly, symptoms improved after treatment with the probiotic VSL#3 in subjects with either
                        diarrhea-predominant IBS<em>17</em> or IBS with bloating.<em>18</em> In subjects complaining of IBS with bloating, the VSL#3
                        reduced flatulence scores and retarded colonic transit time, without altering bowel function. In patients with diarrhea-predominant
                        IBS, VSL#3 only relieved abdominal bloating, having no effect on mean transit measures, bowel function scores or satisfactory relief
                        of symptoms. VSL#3 has also been shown to be superior to a placebo in children with IBS. VSL#3 supplementation improved overall
                        IBS symptoms as assessed by abdominal pain/discomfort, abdominal bloating/gassiness, and on family life disruption.

                        <strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>
                        It is therefore evident, that a multi-species probiotic consisting of multiple species from the genera of <em>Lactobacillus</em>,
                        <em>Bifidobacteria</em>, <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Saccharomyces</em> demonstrates numerous therapeutic effects in relieving
                        symptomologies associated with IBS and UC, with limited evidence for their use in CD.
