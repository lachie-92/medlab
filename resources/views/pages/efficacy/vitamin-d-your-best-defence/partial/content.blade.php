                        This winter thousands of Australians will come down with influenza, otherwise known as the flu. By ensuring you have optimal
                        blood vitamin D levels, you are setting yourself up for the best defence from becoming infected.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The flu is caused by a specific group of RNA viruses and can be spread by an infected person coughing or sneezing.
                        You can also catch the flu from touching an item contaminated by the virus.
                    </p>

                        There is a big difference between a cold and the flu.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        A cold is much less severe. The flu tends to come on suddenly and can make you feel like you’ve been hit by a bus.
                        It causes a high fever and there is usually loss of appetite and coughing. The flu leaves you flat on your back,
                        unable to work or study.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        You may not realise that Influenza causes 1,500 to 3,500 deaths in Australia each year.
                        A new flu vaccine is developed annually, however, because the viruses responsible mutate so quickly,
                        the vaccine is often not effective.<br><br>

                    </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        <em>You probably know that vitamin D is critical for keeping your bones strong, but did you know it benefits your immune system?</em>

                            <p>Your white blood cells contain vitamin D receptors. When vitamin D binds to them, it causes the release of antimicrobial proteins that help your body fight invading viruses and germs.</p>
                            <p>People with lower blood vitamin D levels are more susceptible to getting sick, and tend to have a more severe infection.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    <h4>A study conducted on healthy adults found that people with lower levels of vitamin D
                        were twice as likely to get the flu, compared to people with high levels.</h4>

                    </p>


                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Vitamin D insufficiency is surprisingly common in sunny Australia, particularly in winter. You make vitamin D in your skin when you are
                        exposed to the sun’s UVB rays. Midday is when UVB rays are strongest, and this is the time when many people are indoors working.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        In much of Australia the sun is too weak during winter, therefore even if you are outdoors a lot, you could still be low in vitamin D.
                        A vitamin D supplement may be your best option for keeping your immune system strong.
