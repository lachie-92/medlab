                        Omega-3 Fatty Acids and the Cardiovascular System
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Important fats that enhance the functional physiology of the cardiovascular system are
                        alpha–linolenic acid (ALA), the parent compound of the omega–3 fatty acid family, and
                        linoleic acid (LA), the parent compound of the omega–6 family. ALA and LA are essential
                        fatty acids obtained from the diet, as they cannot be synthesised. Omega–3 fatty acids
                        consist of the long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
                        and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that are of marine origin with oily fish being the richest
                        dietary source.<sup>1</sup>Omega-3 fatty acids have important physiological properties that
                        include anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties.<sup>2</sup>

                    <p>
                        Numerous reviews have summarised the cardiovascular benefits of fish and fish oil consumption
                        in the primary<sup>3</sup> and secondary<sup>4</sup> prevention of cardiovascular conditions.
                        Research on nutrient intakes has shown that regular consumption of omega-3 fats significantly
                        lowers heart-disease risk.<sup>3,4</sup> For example, a report of a cohort from the Nurses
                        Health Study<sup>5</sup> showed that women who ate two-to-four servings of fish a week
                        reduced heart disease risk by 30 per cent. Further, it has been shown that omega–3s reduce
                        blood pressure and heart rate, lower blood triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, and
                        make blood less likely to form clots and create life-threatening thromboses.<sup>5</sup>

                    <p>
                        As a predominant structural component of neural membranes in the brain and retina, DHA has
                        demonstrated to have a positive effect on membrane fluidity and permeability, receptor
                        structure and quantity, carrier mediated transport of nutrients into and out of the cell,
                        enzymatic activities, cell to cell communication and signaling as well as the microenvironment
                        of retinal photoreceptor outer segments.<sup>6,7</sup>

                    <p>
                        DHA has been reported to be of significant importance for foetal brain development, for the
                        optimal development of visual acuity and overall motor skills in infants, to help maintain
                        healthy and balanced lipid metabolism in children and adults, and to support cognition in
                        the elderly.<sup>8</sup> In the area of anti-ageing medicine, essential fatty-acids, in
                        particular the omega-3 long-chain PUFAs, are also increasingly being investigated as
                        therapeutic agents with potential to limit the cognitive decline that accompanies the ageing
                        brain. Furthermore, during ageing, there is also a decrease in brain levels of DHA, and the
                        consumption of fish correlates with a decreased risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
                        The reported daily use of fish-oil supplements, although limited in evidence status,
                        suggests a possible association between omega–3 fatty acids and reduced risk of
                        dementia.<sup>9,10</sup>

                        Coenzyme Q10 as Ubiquinol for Cardiovascular Health
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        There is nothing more critical for all anabolic and catabolic cellular functions than an adequate,
                        constant supply of bioenergy.<sup>11</sup> Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) plays a central role in cellular
                        bioenergy generation and its regulation. Closed membrane systems generate a proton motive force to
                        create transient localized bio-capacitors; the captured energy is used for the synthesis of
                        mitochondrial ATP but also for many other processes, such as metabolite translocations, nerve
                        conduction and a host of other bioenergy requiring processes. Coenzyme Q10 plays a key role
                        in many of these sub-cellular membrane energy generating systems. Integral to this phenomenon
                        is the prooxidant role of coenzyme Q10 in generating the major superoxide anion/hydrogen
                        peroxide second messenger system.<sup>11</sup>

                    <p>
                        A recent review has reported that with advancing age there is a major risk factor for the
                        development of cardiovascular conditions.<sup>12</sup> Moreover that the aetiology of several
                        cardiovascular disorders are thought to involve impaired mitochondrial function and metabolic
                        dysfunction and more importantly of mitochondrial loss (mytophagy and autophagy).<sup>13</sup>
                        CoQ10 acts as both an antioxidant and as a pro-oxidant at the level of the
                        mitochondria.<sup>11</sup> Furthermore, in patients with cardiac conditions, plasma
                        CoQ10 has been found to be an independent predictor of mortality. Based on the fundamental
                        role of CoQ10 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and its well-acknowledged metabolic promoting
                        properties, several clinical trials evaluating CoQ10 have been undertaken in cardiovascular
                        disorders of ageing including chronic heart failure, hypertension and endothelial
                        dysfunction.<sup>12</sup>
