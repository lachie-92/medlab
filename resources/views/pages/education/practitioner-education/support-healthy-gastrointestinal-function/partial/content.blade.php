                        A French microbiologist, Henri Boulard discovered the beneficial yeast <em>Saccharomyces boulardii</em>
                        in 1920. When he was visiting IndoChina he noticed that certain people who drank a special tea did
                        not develop cholera during an outbreak. He isolated the agent in the fruit tea responsible for the
                        therapeutic effects, being S. boulardii.<sup>1</sup> <em>S. boulardii</em> has several different
                        mechanisms of action including luminal action, trophic action and mucosal anti-inflammatory
                        signalling effects. Within the intestinal lumen, <em>S. boulardii</em> may interfere with
                        pathogenic toxins, preserve cellular physiology, interfere with pathogen attachment, interact
                        with normal microbiota and assist in re-establishing short chain fatty acid levels.
                        <em>S. boulardii </em>may also act as an immune regulator, both within the lumen and systemically.
                        Factors that disrupt the normal barrier function of commensal bacteria, such as antibiotic use or
                        surgery, results in host susceptibility to pathogen colonization until the normal microbiota can
                        become re-established. Typically it takes six to eight weeks for normal microbiota to recover after
                        antibiotic use but when <em>S. boulardii</em> is supplemented, normal microbiota is re-established
                        rapidly.<sup>1</sup>Furthermore, <em>S. boulardii</em> has proven effective in treating
                        antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infections, reducing side-effects
                        of triple therapy to treat <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, acute diarrhoea, travellers diarrhoea,
                        Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). <em>S. boulardii</em> has
                        also been assessed for efficacy in treating <em>Giardiasis</em> when combined with metronidazole
                        resulting in significantly less detection of <em>giardia </em>cysts compared to placebo.<sup>1-3</sup>

                        Arabinogalactans are high molecular weight, highly branched, water-soluble polysaccharides
                        containing units of D-galactose and L-arabinose. Arabinogalactans from Larch have been shown to
                        stimulate natural killer cell cytotoxicity <em>in vitro</em> with animal studies demonstrating
                        increases in white blood cell counts i.e. neutrophils and eosinophil’s.<sup>4</sup> ResistAid&trade;
                        is a proprietary arabinogalactan extracted from Larch (<em>Larix laricina</em>) supplied by Lonza
                        Ltd, Switzerland. A number of human clinical studies have demonstrated ResistAid&#39;s&trade;
                        immunomodulatory activity. Udani 2010 demonstrated a daily dose of 4.5 g significantly increased
                        IgG antibody response of healthy volunteers to the pneumococcal vaccine when compared to
                        placebo.<sup>4</sup> In a more recent study Udani 2013 demonstrated that ResistAid&trade; at a dose
                        of 1.5 g daily significantly increased the IgG antibody response to tetanus vaccine compared to
                        placebo.<sup>5</sup> ResistAid&trade; has clinical evidence of being well tolerated in healthy
                        individuals with no demonstrable side-effects.<sup>6</sup>

                        Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the body and plays a central role in inter-organ
                        carbon and nitrogen flux. Glutamine is considered a non-essential amino acid because it is
                        synthesized endogenously, however it can be depleted rapidly in certain clinical settings
                        particularly in response to injury, infection, IBD and short bowel syndrome.<sup>7,8</sup>
                        Glutamine is an important fuel for rapidly dividing cells such as enterocytes, colonocytes and
                        immune cells as it is critical for the biosynthesis of nucleotides required for cell replication
                        and hexosamines. Glutamine and nucleosides act synergistically to promote differentiation and
                        proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells.<sup>8</sup> Furthermore, glucosamine is reported to
                        enhance the immunological barrier due to its trophic action on the immune system and its ability
                        to decreased bacterial translocation.<sup>7</sup>

                        Peppermint leaf and peppermint oil have traditionally been considered to have anti-spasmodic,
                        anti-emetic, carminative and anti-microbial properties. Peppermint is indicated to treat a
                        variety of digestive disorders such as flatulence, diarrhoea, indigestion, nausea and vomiting,
                        and as a spasmolytic to reduce gas and cramping.<sup>9</sup> Peppermint is reported to block
                        calcium channels resulting in gastrointestinal smooth muscle relaxation with a 2008 meta-analysis
                        supporting the use of peppermint for providing short-term relief of discomfort and abdominal pain
                        in IBS patients.<sup>10</sup>

                        Cocoa is naturally rich in polyphenols that have been reported to modulate the gastrointestinal
                        tract. Plasma and urine of chocolate eaters led to the discovery of distinct metabolic profiles
                        according to the behavioural/psychological dietary preference for chocolate products. The
                        metabolism of cocoa polyphenols can induce selective bacterial growth, i.e.
                        <em>Bifidobacterium spp</em>, <em>Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale</em> group
                        and <em>Escherichia coli</em> and significantly inhibit the growth of the
                        <em>Clostridium histolyticum</em> group. Further, bacterial fermentation of the insoluble
                        material of cocoa is associated with an increase in <em>Lactobacilli</em> and
                        <em>Bifidobacterium</em> species as well as butyrate production.<sup>11</sup>
