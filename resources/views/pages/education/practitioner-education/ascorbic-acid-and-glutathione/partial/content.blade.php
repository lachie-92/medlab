                    <p>
                        Manuka-C&trade; is a novel combination of ingredients to support optimal immune system function containing a blend of three
                        ascorbates to be gentle on the stomach. Ascorbic acid and glutathione are essential nutrients for optimal immune function,<sup>1-3</sup>
                        ensuring effective anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activity of white blood cells (WBC)<sup>2,4</sup> with glutathione aiding
                        the physiological role of ascorbic acid recycling and activity within the cell. <sup>4-7</sup> Ascorbic acid together with zinc
                        is also required for wound healing and healthy connective tissue function.<sup>1,3,8</sup> Manuka honey has been used for centuries
                        in the treatment of infections having anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activity.<sup>9-11</sup>

                    <h4>
                        Ascorbic Acid:
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Ascorbic acid is a water-soluble vitamin essential for healthy immune system activity and can only be obtained from the
                        diet due to lack of endogenous synthesis in humans. It is an important catalyst for extensive biochemical reactions and
                        enzymatic processes, and further is a vital redox cofactor.<sup>3</sup> Pharmacokinetic data demonstrates that plasma ascorbic
                        acid levels are tightly regulated, which significantly impacts on the bioavailability of orally administered vitamin C
                        supplements.<sup>1</sup> Optimum bioavailability of ascorbic acid occurs between 200 – 500 mg per day and as the oral dosage
                        increases, bioavailability decreases and excess ascorbic acid is excreted in urine. Plasma ascorbic acid levels plateau at a
                        dose between 500 – 1000 mg and does not increase with increasing doses (see Figure 1).<sup>1</sup> Data demonstrates that
                        circulating WBCs become saturated at an intake of 100 mg per day. Ascorbic acid bioavailability in plasma is near 100% at a
                        single dose of 200 mg but at higher oral vitamin C doses, bioavailability declines significantly with a 1250 mg dose resulting
                        in less than 50% bioavailability (see Figure 2).<sup>1</sup> As the oral dose of ascorbic acid increases so does its excretion
                        in urine (see Figure 3). Elevated doses may have adverse consequences as a 1000 mg dose has been shown to elevate urine uric
                        acid and oxalate levels.  High doses of ascorbic acid are not recommended, as there is no clear benefit of excess excreted
                        or unabsorbed vitamin C.<sup>1</sup> Physiologically, ascorbic acid is required for the effective anti-microbial function of
                        WBCs acting as a reducing agent. It is also a key compensatory factor in the regulation of plasma glutathione concentration.<sup>7</sup>
                        The prophylactic use of ascorbic acid may reduce the incidence, duration and severity of the common cold. <sup>8,12</sup>

                    <h4>
                        Glutathione:
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Glutathione is an intrinsic tripeptide essential for optimal immune function; this is exemplified predominantly in
                        its capacity to facilitate cellular protection and repair as a vital cofactor in the redox process.<sup>2,6</sup>
                        Glutathione is critical for the physiological role of ascorbic acid in white blood cell anti-microbial activity.
                        When exposed to bacteria, neutrophils oxidize extracellular ascorbic acid to form dehydroascorbic acid that is
                        transported into the neutrophil and rapidly reduces back to ascorbic acid within the cell by the redox enzyme
                        glutaredoxin that requires glutathione as a cofactor.<sup>13</sup> As a result of the recycling of ascorbic acid,
                        the internal concentration of ascorbic acid within the WBC increases 10-fold in which it functions to quench oxidants
                        generated during phagocytosis, a natural and controlled physiological process (see Figure 4).<sup>13</sup>

                        <strong>Figure 4. Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and ascorbic acid (AA) transport and recycling in neutrophils.<sup>7</sup></strong>
                        AA and DHA are transported differently into the cell. With activation (i.e. bacterial exposure), neutrophils secrete reactive
                        oxygen species that oxidize extracellular AA to DHA that is then rapidly transported into the neutrophil via the glucose
                        transporters, GLUT1 and GLUT3. Intracellular DHA is immediately reduced to AA via Glutaredoxin (GRX), a glutathione requiring redox enzyme.
                        As a result of DHA transport and reduction, a 10-fold higher AA internal concentration is achieved compared to activity of the AA
                        transporter alone. AA may quench oxidants generated during phagocytosis, a regulated physiological occurrence.

                    <p>
                        Zinc is necessary for numerous metabolic functions, particularly gene expression; cell growth and differentiation.<sup>8</sup>
                        It is a critical nutrient for immune function due to its role in supporting a range of immune reactions.<sup>14</sup> Zinc is
                        a vital component of many proteins, over 300 enzymes; and is regarded as a key nutrient in the support of cellular mediators
                        of innate immunity.<sup>14</sup> Zinc functions in the maturation of T cells and is also responsible for the activity of
                        natural killer cells as well as waste management in WBC.<sup>15</sup> Zinc together with ascorbic acid is shown to produce
                        additive effects in supporting immune function; and together have shown to be effective in reducing the severity
                        and/or duration of the common cold.<sup>8</sup>

                    <p>
                        Manuka honey has been used as a traditional anti-microbial therapy for the treatment of infection.<sup>11</sup> Honey has
                        well documented anti-bacterial activity,<sup>9</sup> together with anti-viral and anti-fungal properties.<sup>16</sup>
                        The anti-inflammatory effects of Manuka honey are effective in assisting the recovery from the common cold;<sup>17</sup>
                        as well as treating symptoms of upper-respiratory tract infections.<sup>18</sup> Emerging evidence has illustrated that
                        honey added to oral rehydration solution (ORS) improved recovery in children following episodes of diarrheal illness.<sup>10</sup>
