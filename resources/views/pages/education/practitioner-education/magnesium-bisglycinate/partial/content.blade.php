                    <p>
                        Mg Optima<sup>TM</sup> Relax contains evidenced-based ingredients to support the natural metabolic
                        pathways for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production and activity, indicated to promote relaxation
                        during times of stress. Albion ® Magnesium bisglycinate is scientifically designed to provide a
                        highly bioavailable form of magnesium. Magnesium may act as a GABA receptor agonist and also has a
                        binding site on the glutamate receptors helping to regulate the activity of this main excitatory
                        neurotransmitter.<sup>1</sup> Glycine functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous
                        system while glutamine is a precursor to GABA production.<sup>2</sup> Theanine is an amino acid
                        from Green Tea that promotes relaxation via binding to glutamate receptors.<sup>3</sup> Pyridoxal
                        (vitamin B6) is a cofactor for the enzyme Glutamate decarboxylase that synthesises GABA from
                        glutamate.<sup>4</sup> Zinc also has a binding site on the glutamate receptor and may act as a
                        modulator for both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.<sup>5</sup>

                    <p>
                        Magnesium is predominantly located intra-cellular in bone, muscles and non-muscular soft tissues
                        while only 1% of total magnesium is found in serum and red blood cells. Magnesium needs to be
                        consumed in the diet regularly to prevent the risk of magnesium deficiency and due to the increased
                        consumption of processed foods; magnesium intake in the western world is decreasing. Magnesium is a
                        cofactor in more than 300 enzymatic reactions, critically stabilising enzymes, including many
                        ATP-generating reactions. ATP metabolism, muscle contraction and relaxation, normal neurological
                        function and release of neurotransmitters are all magnesium dependent.<sup>6</sup> While evidence
                        generally does not support the use of magnesium for skeletal muscle cramps with many studies
                        producing null effect<sup>7,8</sup>, there is evidence to suggest oral magnesium supplementation
                        can improve anaerobic metabolism in athletes, decreasing lactate production<sup>9</sup> and
                        improving physical performance in healthy elderly women involved in an exercise program.<sup>10</sup>

                        Magnesium may function as a GABA receptor agonist promoting the effects of GABA. Further, in the
                        central nervous system (CNS), magnesium ions block NMDAR channels at resting membrane potentials.
                        The binding site for magnesium ions is deep within the channel. This block is voltage-dependent but
                        ion flux occurs when the membrane potential is depolarized. NMDAR receptors are glutamate-binding
                        sites, being the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS.<sup>11</sup> See Figure 1.

                        Glycine functions as one of the major inhibitory neurotransmitters in the CNS with a high density
                        of glycine containing neurons being found in spinal cord and brain stem. When glycine binds to its
                        receptor it opens the anion channel allowing an influx of chloride ions into the postsynaptic
                        neuron causing hyperpolarization that raises the threshold for neuronal firing and thereby inhibits
                        the postsynaptic neuron.<sup>2,13</sup>

                    <p>
                        Glutamine and glutamate are amino acids. Several studies show that concentrations of serum
                        glutamine in the body are diminished during times of physical or psychological stress and further
                        that patients presenting with exhaustion, anxiety, sleeplessness and lack of concentration have
                        low serum glutamate concentration. Glutamine and glutamate synthesis occur interchangeably
                        (see figure 2). Glutamine converts to glutamate using NADPH as a cofactor and glutamate is a
                        precursor for GABA production using vitamin B6 as a cofactor.<sup>15-19</sup>

                        <strong>L-Theanine</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Theanine is a novel plant-based amino acid found in tea (<em>Camellia sinensis</em>) leaves.
                        Theanine is an analog of glutamic acid and is able to bind to glutamate receptor subtypes (AMPA,
                        kainite and NMDA receptors) and block the binding of glutamate to the receptors, albeit with less
                        affinity for the receptor than glutamate.<sup>21</sup> Studies have shown that L-Theanine is
                        useful in the treatment of anxiety due to its ability to regulate neurotransmitter function in
                        the CNS as well as improving the quality of sleep. L-Theanine supplementation in the standard
                        dosages (50-250mg) has been shown to increase α-brainwaves in otherwise healthy persons, which
                        is indicative of a perceived state of relaxation. This may only occur in persons with higher
                        baseline anxiety or under periods of stress, but has been shown to occur during closed eye rest
                        as well as during visuospatial tasks around 30 minutes after ingestion.<sup>22-26</sup> See Figure
                        1.

                    <p>
                        When administered orally, L-Theanine peaks in serum within an hour and appears in the urine after
                        5 hours. Theanine reaches maximum concentration in the brain within 5 hours and gradually
                        disappears within 24 hours. It freely crosses the blood-brain barrier and appears in the brain
                        within an hour after ingestion.<sup>27</sup> A recent study demonstrated that L-Theanine could
                        cause anti-stress activity via inhibition of cortical neuron excitation. The results showed that
                        L-Theanine intake resulted in a reduction in the heart rate (HR) and salivary immunoglobulin A
                        (s-IgA) responses to an acute stress task relative to the placebo control group that the authors
                        attributed to an attenuation of sympathetic nervous activation.<sup>3</sup>

                        Pyridoxine is the cofactor required by Glutamate decarboxylase to convert glutamate to GABA in the

                        Approximately 10% of total zinc in the brain is located in synaptic vesicles of certain
                        glutamatergic neurons.<sup>5</sup> Zinc may modulate neurotransmission mediated via both excitatory
                        and inhibitory amino acid receptors at specific synapses for example the NMDA glutamate receptor is
                        directly inhibited by zinc whereas GABA release from the presynapse can be potentiated
                        (see Figure 1).<sup>28</sup>
