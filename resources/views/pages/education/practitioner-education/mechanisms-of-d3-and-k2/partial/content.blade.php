                        <strong>MECHANISMS OF ACTION FOR VITAMIN D3 AND K2</strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Vitamin D3:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a lipid-soluble vitamin that is naturally synthesised in the body
                        from ultraviolet light exposure, however it’s availability may be reduced in people with a dark complexion,
                        the elderly and in those with chronic kidney disease.<sup>10</sup> Vitamin D deficiency is becoming more
                        common in the urban landscape due to occupational and lifestyle factors associated with current standards
                        of modern living; as well as the widespread use of sunscreens, and seasonal and environmental
                        factors.<sup>11</sup> Vitamin D3 aids in dietary calcium and phosphorus absorption, which is important
                        for maintaining healthy BMD and is used in the treatment and prevention of bone disorders such as rickets,
                        osteomalacia and is essential in preventing the development of osteoporosis in later life.<sup>2,3,10</sup>
                        Supplementation with D3 in conjunction with calcium has been effectively administered in primary care to
                        prevent fractures; and there is also evidence to suggest that cholecalciferol has beneficial therapeutic
                        effects on myelination and recovery following nerve injury.<sup>12,13</sup> Vitamin D3 binds to the vitamin
                        D receptor (VDR), which is located on all somatic tissue cells, including immune system cells; D3 is also
                        responsible for the activation or repression of gene expression, and simultaneously acts as a control
                        system for innate and adaptive immune system function including Th<sub>1</sub>, Th<sub>2</sub>, Treg
                        and Th<sub>17</sub> responses.<sup>14,15</sup> Additionally, vitamin D3 is involved in the attenuation
                        of inflammatory responses and chronic conditions, as well as the promotion of healthy respiratory
                        function.<sup>16,17</sup> Because the absorption of dietary calcium within the human body is so dependent
                        on the availability of vitamin D, the need for supplementation in individuals living in a modern-day
                        environment is often necessary to impede the proliferation of preventable disease.<sup>18,19</sup>

                        <strong>Vitamin K2:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vitamin K serves as an obligatory cofactor for an essential carboxylase enzyme that activates seven
                        protein components of the blood-coagulation cascade, and is essential for the post translational
                        carboxylation of glutamate into gamma-carboxyglutamate (Gla) residues in Gla-proteins that are
                        required for clot formation and bone mineralization.<sup>4,5</sup> Carboxylation of the proteins
                        osteocalcin and matrix-Gla which are essential for normal bone metabolism depend on the availability
                        of vitamin K.<sup>4</sup> Whilst vitamin K1 is commonly found in leafy green vegetables, the alternative
                        form vitamin K2 (Menaquinone-7) is long-chain menquinone found in high concentrations in fermented foods
                        such as natto, and holds longer lasting positive effects than other common forms of the vitamin such
                        as K1 and meniquinone-4.<sup>5</sup> A clinical trial determined that long term use of menaquinone-7
                        may improve arterial stiffness in healthy postmenopausal females.<sup>6</sup> Vitamin K2 (menaquinone-7)
                        has been proven to be extremely beneficial for postmenopausal women as supplementation may improve
                        serum vitamin K2 status helping to reduce bone loss.<sup>7</sup>
