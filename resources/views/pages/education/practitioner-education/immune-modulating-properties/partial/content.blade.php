                        <strong>Lactoferrin:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lactoferrin is an abundant protein found in breast milk, and is secreted in tears, saliva, intestinal mucus, genital secretions
                        and in found in granules of neutrophils. Lactoferrin is a glycoprotein belonging to the transferrin family of iron-binding
                        proteins. As a multifunctional protein it demonstrates potent anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and
                        immunomodulatory activity providing an effective defense mechanism for the mammalian body.<sup>1</sup> The bactericidal effect of lactoferrin
                        is in part due to its ability to bind to and withhold iron that is essential for pathogenic bacterial growth, resulting in
                        bacteriostatic effects.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, lactoferrin disrupts the integrity of pathogenic bacterial cell walls by binding to
                        lipopolysaccharides causing cell wall degradation.<sup>1</sup> Clinical evidence from a recent Cochrane review demonstrated the therapeutic
                        activity of lactoferrin for the prevention of sepsis and NEC in preterm infants.<sup>3</sup>

                        <strong>Colostrum:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Often described as the first food of life, colostrum is a sweet sticky mammary secretion produced
                        by mammals generally during the 24-48-hour perinatal period to provide essential immune-building nutrients to the offspring.
                        Containing vital antibodies, vitamins and proteins, colostrum particularly of bovine origin has been used in the treatment and
                        prevention of infectious diseases.<sup>4</sup> The diverse immune-enhancing factors of colostrum prove to have significant beneficial
                        therapeutic applications, particularly due to its rich supply of immunoglobulin Ig (IgG).<sup>2</sup> Clinical trials have shown
                        therapeutic benefit from the use of bovine colostrum in patients suffering chronic infection and pain; as well as being an
                        effective prophylactic for gram negative sepsis, influenza and severe diarrhea. 4,5 It has also been shown to prevent gastric
                        damage in patients using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications; and not only proves to be a substance with superior
                        immunological activity but is also an optimum dietary supplement.<sup>5,6</sup> There is some evidence which implies that a colostrum
                        supplement is beneficial to those who are immunocompromised suffering from a severe diarrheal illness.<sup>6</sup>

                        <strong>Arabinogalactan:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arabinogalactans are highly branched, water-soluble polysaccharides with a high molecular weight that are found in a wide
                        variety of plants. Arabinogalactans specifically from Larch are an excellent dietary fiber supplement that are capable of
                        increasing beneficial gastrointestinal (GI) commensal bacteria as well as short-chain fatty acid production.<sup>7,8</sup> As an
                        effective defense against the common cold infection, Larch arabinogalactan has also been shown in animal studies to
                        stimulate natural killer cell cytotoxicity in vitro, demonstrating an increase in white blood cell counts i.e. neutrophils
                        and eosinophil’s.<sup>9,10</sup> ResistAid™ is a proprietary arabinogalactan extracted from Larch (Larix laricina) supplied by Lonza
                        Ltd, Switzerland. A number of human clinical studies have demonstrated ResistAid's™ immunomodulatory activity in which a
                        daily dose of 4.5 g significantly increased IgG antibody response of healthy volunteers to the pneumonia vaccine when
                        compared to placebo.<sup>10</sup> In a more recent study Udani 2013 demonstrated that ResistAid™ at a dose of 1.5 g daily significantly
                        increased the IgG antibody response to tetanus vaccine compared to placebo.<sup>11</sup> ResistAid™ has clinical evidence of being
                        well tolerated in healthy individuals with no demonstrable side-effects.<sup>10,12</sup>

                        <strong>Lactobacillus paracasei and Bifidobacterium lactis:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The GI commensal microbiota significantly influences the health of the host, supported by extensive scientific evidence.
                        Whilst there are numerous publications exemplifying the range of positive benefits of probiotic bacteria, the mechanisms
                        by which they benefit health and the specific species and strains are of a growing interest within the scientific community.<sup>13</sup>
                        A recent Cochrane review examined clinical studies assessing live microorganism intervention in cold and flu treatment,
                        and found that probiotic bacteria including various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species were effective in reducing the
                        symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections.<sup>14</sup> Two clinical trials demonstrated that daily consumption of a
                        probiotic product containing Lactobacillus paracasei increased the antibody response (IgG) to influenza vaccination in elderly
                        participants.<sup>15,16</sup> Additional research has shown that consumption of probiotics containing both Lactobacillus paracasei and
                        Bifidobacterium lactis increases the antigen-specific immune response (IgG and sIgA) of patients receiving the influenza vaccine,
                        further supporting their immune modulatory effects.<sup>16</sup> The results from two systematic reviews demonstrated that the use of
                        probiotics in children is effective in diminishing the incidence and the severity of the symptoms of upper respiratory tract
                        infections.<sup>17,18</sup>
