                    </h3>

                    <p>
                    Probiotics are living organisms found in food and dietary supplements, which upon ingestion can improve the health of the host beyond their inherent basic nutritional content.<sup>9</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The gastrointestinal (GIT) mucosal surface is a complex and interactional environment, which is continuously exposed to a range of commensal microorganisms.
                    The human-microbial gastrointestinal interface is an ecosystem that participates in a variety of important roles in human health and disease.<sup>10,11</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The microbiome interacts with the human host’s GIT by providing the necessary prompts for the development of regulated pro- and anti-inflammatory signals,
                    that overall promote immunological tolerance as well as metabolic and inflammatory homeostasis. This then, exerting regulatory control over local and
                    extra-intestinal activities (e.g. skin, liver, brain).<sup>10,11</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To ensure proper immune-digestive efficiency and overall intestinal function, a balance in the overall composition of the gut microbiota would seem to be a
                    necessary prerequisite throughout a lifetime. The continued understanding of this functionality presents a view of the GIT that is wide ranging in health
                    importance and with implications in a variety of health issues from immunological tolerance, obesity and metabolic disorders.<sup>11,12</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The number of bacterial cells in the body exceed human cells by a factor of 10 to 1, with the largest concentration being in the GIT.<sup>12</sup> Hence, it would not
                    be unexpected that such a concentration of microorganisms in the GIT may have strong correlations with colonic conditions such as Inflammatory Bowel
                    Diseases (IBDs), constipation, obesity, chronic diseases of metabolism (e.g., Type II Diabetes Mellitus) and some cancers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Recent research has focused on elucidating the inter-relationships that may exist between the GIT microbiome and its host in health and disease.<sup>9,13</sup> It
                    is reported that the GIT microbiome is being continuously compromised with factors such as over consumption of dietary fat,<sup>10,11</sup> gut-stressing physical
                    exercise,<sup>12</sup> increasing urbanisation<sup>14</sup> and medical therapies.<sup>15</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Recent studies for example, have shown that a short course of antibiotics can be the source of long-term changes in the gut microbiome.<sup>16</sup> This suggests
                    that antibiotic administration in early life could permanently and adversely alter the gut microbiome. This in conjunction with continued exacerbations
                    of the gut commensal microbiome driven by adverse lifestyle choices may predispose to the development of chronic diseases.<sup>12</sup>
