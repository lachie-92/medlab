                        A significant body of research has been conducted demonstrating digestive and colonic health
                        benefits of High Amylose Maize Starch (HAMS) with research also showing metabolic advantages.<sup>1</sup>
                        Resistant starch is the total amount of starch, and the products of starch degradation that
                        resists digestion in the small intestine. Hi-Maize demonstrates numerous health benefits
                        such as increasing satiety and helping with weight control, assisting with glycaemic
                        management and promoting digestive health. Hi-Maize demonstrates increased satiety compared
                        to other forms of fibre helping people to feel fuller in the hours after consuming it<sup>2</sup> and
                        has also shown to help people eat less after 2 hours<sup>3</sup> as well over the proceeding 24 hours.<sup>4</sup>
                        Hi-Maize consumption has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people,<sup>5,6</sup>
                        in people with type 2 diabetes<sup>7</sup> and in individuals with insulin resistance.<sup>8-10</sup> Furthermore,
                        as a prebiotic, Hi-Maize supports beneficial bacterial growth and activity, increasing
                        short-chain fatty acid production and  assisting with normal intestinal function.<sup>11-13</sup>

                        Leucine has a unique role in metabolic regulation beyond the fundamental role of being an
                        amino acid, a substrate for the synthesis of proteins. Leucine has a direct link to the
                        maintenance of glucose homeostasis by enhancing the recycling of glucose via the glucose-alanine
                        cycle and stimulates muscle protein synthesis through the insulin-signaling cascade during
                        catabolic periods such as fasting or energy restriction.<sup>14,15</sup> Further, leucine supplementation
                        stimulates recovery of muscle protein synthesis after exercise. The mechanisms of leucine
                        appear to contribute to a metabolic advantage during weight loss.<sup>15</sup> L-Carnitine is
                        crucial for beta-oxidation, facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the
                        mitochondrial membrane for oxidation. When combined with weight loss motivation, the beneficial
                        effects of L-Carnitine are amplified including significant body weight loss and a decrement of
                        serum triglyceride levels when compared to participants supplementing with L-Carnitine but
                        being assigned to a non-motived group for weight loss.<sup>16</sup> DL-α-hydroxy isocaproic acid (HICA)
                        is an end product of leucine metabolism in human tissues such as muscle and connective tissue
                        and is considered an anti-catabolic substance. HICA has demonstrated to increase whole lean
                        body mass in healthy athletes and also decreased whole body delayed-onset muscle soreness
                        (DOMS) symptoms.<sup>17</sup> The Medlab Lactobacilli plantarum (Med 25) and Lactobacillus paracasei
                        (Med 24) have demonstrated the highest production of HICA when co-cultured with leucine.
