                        <strong>IS VITAMIN D3 ESSENTIAL</strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        In addition to its well-known classical effects in calcium/phosphate homeostasis, vitamin D is a
                        potent regulator of many other vital physiological functions in the body beyond that of bone
                        health such as immune regulation.<sup>1</sup> Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is naturally synthesised in the
                        skin and may contribute to 80-90% of the vitamin D supply within the body but this is ultimately
                        dependent on factors such as sun exposure, geographic latitude, season, clothing habits,
                        sunscreen use and skin complexion. Dietary sources of vitamin D3 are limited but include fatty
                        fish, fish liver oil, beef liver, egg yolk and milk.<sup>1,2</sup> Cholecalciferol is biologically inert and
                        must undergo two hydroxylation reactions, first within the liver to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin
                        D [25(OH)D] also known as calcidiol, and then in the kidney to produce the active hormonal
                        metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] also know as calcitriol.<sup>3,4</sup> Further,
                        25(OH)D can be converted to 1,25(OH)2D in at least 10 extra-renal tissues including
                        immune cells (macrophages, dendritic cells and B-lymphocytes) and also vascular smooth muscle
                        cells and colonocytes.<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a lipid-soluble compound, orally ingested cholecalciferol (D3) is naturally emulsified into
                        lipid droplets and combined with bile salts, phospholipids and cholesterol to form micelles that
                        enable absorption across in the intestinal mucosa. A fraction of D3 enters enterocytes via passive
                        diffusion when delivered at pharmacological doses, but the main intracellular transport of D3
                        into the enterocyte is via binding the micelle to apical membrane transporters. Intestinal
                        absorption of vitamin D3 varies between 55-99% (mean 78%) in healthy individuals<sup>2</sup> but is
                        decreased in individuals with conditions of malabsorption such as cystic fibrosis, inflammatory
                        bowel disease, coeliac disease, biliary obstruction, pancreatic dysfunction and intestinal
                        resection.<sup>5,6</sup> Furthermore, disruption in the conversion of vitamin D metabolites to the active
                        hormone will also impact vitamin D status within the body such as in chronic kidney disease.<sup>7</sup>

                        The micellization process of drugs and nutrients prior to ingestion produces nano-sized particles
                        consisting of an inner hydrophobic core (drug/nutrient combined with lipid carrier or is itself
                        lipid-soluble) with a hydrophilic outer shell (various surfactants) creating a water-soluble
                        solution that interacts with the mucosal cells. Figure 1 demonstrates an example of micellizing
                        the fat-soluble compound, beta-carotene.

                        NanoCelle&trade; D3 consists of cholecalciferol forming the hydrophobic core coated with
                        hydrophilic compounds to obtain a particle size approximately 50 - 200 nm (0.05 â€“ 0.2 micron)
                        that is soluble in aqueous solution (Figure 2). The uptake of the micelle particles across the
                        mucosal membrane and the extent of drug/nutrient absorption increases with decreasing particle
                        size.<sup>8,9</sup> Drug delivery via the oral mucosa by-passes the gastrointestinal tract
                        and any conditions that may influence or inhibit its absorption across the intestinal mucosa.

                        The secosteroid hormone 1,25(OH)2D is the biologically active form of vitamin D3 and initiates
                        physiological responses of more than 36 cell types that possess the vitamin D receptor (VDR)
                        on their cell membrane or in the cytosol, by regulating gene transcription and activating signal
                        transduction pathways similar to other steroid hormones.Cholecalciferol itself does not bind to
                        the VDR. It is estimated that the VDR can regulate the expression of 3% of the human
                        genome.<sup>10</sup> It is well established that 1,25(OH)2D plays a vital role in adaptive
                        and innate immune regulation from inducing the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages;
                        increasing macrophage activity and cytotoxic activity; inducing the synthesis of the antibacterial
                        proteins cathelicidin and beta-defensin; inducing IFN-gamma-mediated antimicrobial activity and
                        regulating Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 responses (Figure 3).<sup>11</sup>
