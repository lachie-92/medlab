                        <strong>WHY AN ACTIVATED FORM OF B12?</strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>NanoCelle&trade; Activated B12 may assist in the management of dietary vitamin B12 deficiency as may occur in vegetarians, vegans, the elderly, and those taking certain medications that lower stomach acid. Methylcobalamin is a biologically active form of vitamin B12 that is involved in the methylation of homocysteine to methionine, therefore helping to lower serum homocysteine levels. Vitamin B12 is required for red blood cell production, synthesis of myelin that is vital to healthy neurological function and DNA methylation. NanoCelle@trade; delivers nanoparticle-sized molecules of the vitamin for absorption across the oral buccal mucosa, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract and greatly enhancing nutrient absorption with superior bioavailability.</p>

                    <p>Vitamin B12 is one of the most complex vitamins in regards to its absorption and transport within the body and depends critically on a very tightly regulated transport system. Vitamin B12 is continually partnered with binding proteins throughout the digestive tract and blood stream and then requires a binder specific cellular receptor for intracellular transport. Intrinsic factor (IF), which is released from the stomach and is required to mediate transport of B12 into enterocytes in the ileum, is saturable, the rate at which varies inversely with the amount of B12 ingested. The IF-mediated transport rarely allows more than 1 to 2 g of B12 to be absorbed at any one time, therefore high doses quickly exceed the absorptive capacity of the body, with unabsorbed B12 being excreted in the faeces. Nonspecific and linear non-saturable diffusion does occur, in which a receptor is not required, however this fraction is extremely small and estimated to be approximately 1%.<sup>1</sup></p>

                    <strong>NanoCelle™ Delivery of Vitamin B12</strong>

                    <p>A novel way to bypass the limited absorptive capacity of vitamin B12 in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is to utilize the rich blood supply of the buccal mucosa. The buccal mucosa is non-keratinized and is therefore more permeable to water-soluble particles than keratinized epithelium such as the hard palate. The buccal mucosa is 40-50 cell layers thick, and compared to intestinal cells, may also have less tight junctions but a higher level of lipid intercellular matrix.<sup>1</sup> Once the NanoCelle@trade; molecule diffuses through the mucus layer and aqueous boundary layer on the surface of the epithelium, it may then transverse across the epithelium via passive diffusion (See Figure 1).<sup>2</sup> There are no B12 receptors on oral epithelium cells i.e. such as the cubam receptor on ileum enterocytes that facilitate the entry of IF-bound cobalamin into the enterocytes for transport into the blood stream.</p>

The buccal mucosa has a rich supply of blood vessels.<sup>3</sup>

                    <strong>Function of Methylcobalamin</strong>

                    <p>Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin – Cbl) exists in two active forms, methylcobalamin (MeCbl) and adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) that participate in specific physiological processes in the cell. MeCbl is a cofactor for the cytosolic methionine synthase enzyme and AdoCbl is the cofactor for the mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. In the cytosol, MeCbl is involved in transferring its methyl group to homocysteine to form methionine, which is part of the S-adenosyl methionine cycle. Elevated serum homocysteine levels are associated with increased risk of heart attack, stroke, blood clots and cognitive impairment.<sup>4,5</sup> AdoCbl is a key component of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway of carbohydrate metabolism, catalyzing the isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA resulting in ATP generation in cells (see Figure 2).<sup>6,7</sup> Methionine is required for the synthesis of myelin, therefore MeCbl is required for healthy nerve function. Further, while AdoCbl and CNCbl can increase DNA-methylation by methyltransferase, MeCbl is the most efficient compound.<sup>6</sup>

                    <p>Figure 2. Methylcobalamin acts in the cytoplasm where it is involved in the Methionine cycle and Adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria where it is involved in the Krebs cycle.<sup>7</sup></p>

                    <p>Both hydroxy- (HOCbl) and cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) are able to convert to both the methyl- and adenosylcobalamin forms. It has been shown that this conversion can occur just after supplementation in the blood stream. There are some rare genetic conditions in which cyanocobalamin cannot be converted to the active forms.<sup>6,7</sup> It is not known if methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin supplementation results in these active forms reaching the cell intact and whether they are able to directly participate in their physiological roles. It has been recently suggested that the trafficking and assimilation of all forms of cobalamin (MeCbl, AdoCbl, CNCbl and HOCbl) likely follow the same metabolic steps in the body: cross the intestinal/mucosal barrier, bind to transcobalamin, undergo cellular internalization and lysosomal processing. Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria type C protein (MMACHC) in the cytosol then removes the upper ligand’s of Cbl via dealkylation (MeCbl, AdoCbl), decyanation (CnCbl) or reduction (CNCbl, HOCbl) preparing Cbl for being methylated or adenosylated, converting it into the coenzyme forms.<sup>6,7</sup> All forms of Cbl appear to be absorbed and efficient in treating vitamin B12 deficiency</p>
