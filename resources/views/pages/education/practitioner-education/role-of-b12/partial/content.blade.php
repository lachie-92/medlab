                    <p>
                        Oral cyanocobalamin supplementation exists in the free unbound state and is absorbed across the
                        gastrointestinal mucosa by passive diffusion, but only to the extent of approximately 1% over a
                        dosage range of 100 μg to 5 mg. Dietary B12 however, is protein bound and requires pepsin and
                        stomach acid for its release and subsequent binding to intrinsic factor for absorption across the
                        enterocytes.<sup>1</sup> Nanotechnology offers a form of oral drug delivery that enhances the absorptive
                        process and allows the release of the chosen drug/nutrient in a controlled manner. The
                        nanocellisation of drugs and nutrients produces nano-sized particles consisting of an inner
                        hydrophobic core (drug/nutrient combined with lipid carrier or is itself fat-soluble) with a
                        hydrophilic outer shell (various surfactants) that interacts with the mucosal cells (Figure 1).
                        NanoCelle&trade; B12 consists of cyanocobalamin combined with d-alpha tocopherol (vitamin E) to form
                        the hydrophobic core coated with hydrophilic compounds obtaining a particle size approximately
                        50 - 200 nm (0.05 – 0.2 micron) that is soluble in aqueous solution. The uptake of the nanocelle&trade;
                        particles across the mucosal membrane and the extent of drug/nutrient absorption increases with
                        decreasing particle size.<sup>2,3</sup>

                        Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is an organometallic compound that contains cobalt in its chemical
                        structure. Cyanocobalamin and hydroxycobalamin are relatively inert forms of B12 and must be
                        metabolised to the biologically active forms as methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin within the
                        cell cytosol and mitochondria respectively, which function as coenzymes for numerous biological
                        pathways.<sup>4,5,6</sup> It is the R-group attached to the cobalt element that chemically differentiates the
                        various forms of B12.<sup>4</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cobalamin is involved in one-carbon transfer pathways in the form of methylcobalamin, which
                        transfers methyl groups to homocysteine, converting it to methionine and is catalyzed by the
                        methionine synthase enzyme (Figure 2). In addition to lowering serum homocysteine levels, the
                        methionine produced is essential for protein synthesis and the synthesis of myelin that forms the
                        insulating myelin sheath surrounding the axons of neurons. Myelin, and therefore B12, is essential
                        for nerve transmission and proper functioning of the nervous system.<sup>4</sup> A deficiency of B12 may lead
                        to the inhibition of methionine synthase activity causing methyltetrahhydrofolate (CH3-THF) to
                        accumulate resulting in state of functional folate deficiency.<sup>6</sup>

                        Theactivation of folate by B12 is essential for DNA synthesis which is impacted by B12 deficiency.<sup>4</sup>
                        Adenosylcobalamin is essential for the synthesis of succinyl-CoA within the mitochondria from amino
                        acids and fatty acids, which then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy (ATP)
                        production in cells.<sup>6</sup>

                    <p>
                        B12 is synthesized solely by bacteria or microorganisms, with gastrointestinal commensals such as
                        Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Bacteroides species known to produce and release B12 within the
                        gut lumen, however not in sufficient amounts to maintain adequate serum levels.<sup>4</sup> Dietary B12
                        deficiency is prevalent in both developing and Western countries, particularly the elderly,
                        vegetarians, vegans and people with malabsorption issues causing functional deficiency (i.e.
                        low stomach acid, inadequate synthesis of intrinsic factor, coeliac disease and inflammatory
                        bowel disease).
