                        </strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        Important fats that enhance the functional physiology of the cardiovascular system are
                        alpha–linolenic acid (ALA), the parent compound of the omega–3 fatty acid family, and
                        linoleic acid (LA), the parent compound of the omega–6 family. ALA and LA are essential
                        fatty acids obtained from the diet, as they cannot be synthesised. Omega–3 fatty acids
                        consist of the long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
                        and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that are of marine origin with oily fish being the richest
                        dietary source.<sup>1</sup>Omega-3 fatty acids have important physiological properties that
                        include anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties.<sup>2</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Numerous reviews have summarised the cardiovascular benefits of fish and fish oil consumption
                        in the primary<sup>3</sup> and secondary<sup>4</sup> prevention of cardiovascular conditions.
                        Research on nutrient intakes has shown that regular consumption of omega-3 fats significantly
                        lowers heart-disease risk.<sup>3,4</sup> For example, a report of a cohort from the Nurses
                        Health Study<sup>5</sup> showed that women who ate two-to-four servings of fish a week
                        reduced heart disease risk by 30 per cent. Further, it has been shown that omega–3s reduce
                        blood pressure and heart rate, lower blood triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, and
                        make blood less likely to form clots and create life-threatening thromboses.<sup>5</sup>

                        <strong>Plant Sterols for Healthy Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Support</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Plant sterols were first described for their cholesterol lowering effects in the 1950’s, when they
                        were isolated from vegetable fats/oils and pine trees and were chemically analyzed for their
                        effectiveness. Plant sterol and stanols can lower blood cholesterol by decreasing intestinal
                        absorption of cholesterol. Given that sterols and stanols structurally resemble cholesterol,
                        they interfere with micellar solubilisation of dietary and biliary cholesterol present in the
                        intestinal lumen and therefore less cholesterol is absorbed into the systemic circulation.
                        <sup>6-8</sup> Besides lowering serum LDL-C concentrations, it has been shown that plant sterol
                        and stanol esters lower serum TAG levels, particularly in subjects with the metabolic syndrome
                        who are characterized by elevated TAG concentrations. The mechanism of lowering TAGs has
                        theoretically been proposed to be due to either acting on enhanced clearance from the circulation
                        or decreased TAG appearance in the circulation.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, murine studies have shown
                        that plant sterols and stanols can protect against a high fat, high cholesterol diet-induced
                        non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – liver inflammation but not from liver fatty acid
                        accumulation.<sup>10</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A meta-analysis of 41 trials concluded that on average, an intake of 1.5-2.0 g/day of stanol and
                        sterols decreased LDL-C by 10%.<sup>11</sup> An additional study of 59 clinical studies concluded
                        that plant sterol containing products reduced LDL concentrations but the reduction was related to
                        individuals\' baseline LDL levels, food carrier, and frequency and time of intake.<sup>12</sup>
                        Both studies similarly concluded that ingesting greater than 2.5 grams per day of plant sterols
                        and stanols did not add any greater benefits of lowering a greater percentage of blood cholesterol.<sup>11,12</sup>

                        <strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids combined with Plant Sterols</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel efficacy study investigated the
                        dose-response relation between a low dose (&lt;2 g/d) of EPA + DHA from fish oil combined with
                        plant sterols and the affect on serum TAGs and LDL-C levels.<sup>13</sup>A total of 247
                        participants were included in the study and randomised to either the control group or 1 of 4
                        interventions containing a fixed amount of plant sterols (2.5 g/d) and varying amounts of EPA +
                        DHA (0-1.8 g/d) for 4 weeks. The authors reported that a combination of EPA + DHA from fish oil
                        and plant sterols decreases serum TAGs concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (9-16%) while
                        also decreasing LDL-C concentrations (≈ 13%) in a population with elevated cholesterol but normal
                        TAG levels.<sup>13</sup>
