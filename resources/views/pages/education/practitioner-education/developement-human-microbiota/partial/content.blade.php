                        <strong>DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN MAMMARY MICROBIOTA</strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        It is only within the last decade that a complex microbiome was discovered in the placenta, amniotic fluid and breast milk, which were
                        once believed to be sterile. Infants were only thought to be exposed to microbes during birth, i.e. the mother’s vaginal microbiome or
                        that of the hospital staff and surgical environment when delivered via cesarean section. The evolution of the infant gut microbiome does
                        however begin in utero. Continued evolution of the microbiome after birth is influenced by numerous factors including diet, medications,
                        toxins, illness and other stressors.<sup>1,2</sup>

                        In Utero Exposure to Bacteria colonisation of the mucosa of the digestive, respiratory, urogenital tracts and the skin begins before
                        birth. The placental microbiome has recently been characterised and comprises non-pathogenic commensal microbiota from the Firmicutes,
                        Tenericutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides and Fusobacteria phyla, which do share some similarities of the oral microbiome.<sup>2,3</sup> During the
                        first week of life, a full term infant is largely colonised by bacteria from the Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroides and much
                        less by the Firmicutes. Firmicutes and Tenericutes, however, dominate the gut microbiota of a pre-term infant. It is understood that
                        the exposure to antenatal sources of commensal bacteria, varies by length of gestation. During the third trimester of pregnancy the
                        bacterial density in the placenta and also that of the breast milk significantly increases. Further, at this time the foetus begins to
                        swallow large amounts of amniotic fluid that harbours commensal bacteria (see Figure 1).<sup>1,2</sup>

                        Breast Milk Microbiome
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                        Breast milk not only provides bioactive molecules to the infant, including: immunocompetent cells, immunoglobulins, fatty acids,
                        oligosaccharides, lactoferrin and antimicrobial peptides, but constitutes one of the main sources of bacteria to the breast fed
                        infant gut and a baby consuming approximately 800 mL/day of milk would ingest between 1 x105 – 1 x 107 bacteria per day. The
                        oligosaccharides play a vital role in driving the diversity of the infant gut microbiota.<sup>1</sup> Potential sources of bacteria present
                        in human colostrum and milk are proposed to be through the Enteromammary pathway, based on a plausible scientific basis. Dendritic
                        cells (DC) are able to penetrate the gut epithelium, extending dendrites into the gut lumen and directly sample/collect the bacteria.
                        Intestinal DCs and macrophages can retain small numbers of live commensal bacteria for several days in the mesenteric lymph nodes.
                        DCs can then translocate these bacteria to other body sites including the lactating mammary gland.<sup>1,4</sup> The proposed method of bacterial
                        transfer from the maternal GIT to the mammary gland is shown in Figure 2.

                            <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Enteromammary Pathway: Dendritic cells in the lamina propria send dendrites into the maternal gut lumen via tight junctions
                            and trap commensal gut bacteria and transport them back to the lamina propria and from here to mesenteric lymph nodes. Once inside dendritic
                            cells and/or macrophages, gut bacteria can spread to other locations such as the mammary gland and therefore into breast milk and possibly the
                            placenta, as there is a circulation of lymphocytes within the mucosal-associated lymphoid system.<sup>4</sup>

                        Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are among the most abundant genera found in breast milk. Lactic acid bacteria in breast milk generates
                        an anaerobic environment in the neonate gut by consuming oxygen, promoting Bifidobacterium growth and later for several intestinal
                        strains after weaning. The milk microbiota is vital for the neonates immune and GIT maturation, without bacteria this simply does
                        not occur.<sup>4</sup> There are large differences in neonatal gut colonisation between breastfed and formula fed infants. It has
                        been demonstrated that term breast fed infants are dominated by Bifidobacteria species but decreased Enterobacteria species, whereas
                        formula fed infants demonstrate a more diverse array of bacteria including Escherichia coli, Clostridium, Bacteroides,
                        Prevotella and Lactobacillus species.<sup>2</sup>

                        Alterations in the GIT microbiome is reported in numerous conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel
                        conditions, depression etc. For example overweight pregnant women demonstrate low numbers of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides species
                        compared to normal weight pregnant women.<sup>5</sup> It is apparent that the maternal GIT microbiome provides the cue for foetal and neonate.
                        colonisation via the proposed bacterial translocation to breast milk, placenta and amniotic fluid. If the mother therefore has a
                        dysbiotic gut, it will impact on the type of bacteria available for colonisation of the infant. Research has shown that supplementing
                        women during their pregnancy with probiotics can lead to those selected species colonisation in the infants gut. Further studies have
                        shown that administering Lactobacillus rhamnosus to mothers 4 weeks before delivery and 3 weeks after delivery induced specific changes
                        in the transfer and initial establishment of Bifidobacteria in neonates compared to those that received placebo.<sup>5,6</sup> The administration
                        of probiotics during pregnancy and after birth is supported by numerous research papers, particularly with L. rhamnosus and various Bifidobacteruim
                        species, however the results are not consistent. Furthermore, the GIT microbiome in the neonate is responsible for re-establishing a TH1 to TH2
                        balance, with a stimulation of TH17 and TReg Cells involved in infant immune maturation.<sup>2</sup>
