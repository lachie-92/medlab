                        <strong>EFFICACY OF SACCHAROMYCES BOULARDII</strong>
                    </h3>

                    <p>
                        <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae ssp. boulardii</em> was discovered in 1920 by Henri Boulard, who isolated the yeast
                        from the skins of lychee and mangosteen fruit when visiting IndoChina. During a cholera outbreak he noticed
                        that the people who drank tea made from these fruit skins did not contract the infection. Over the last few decades,
                        interest in the therapeutic applications of using SB has increased with now well over 53 randomised controlled
                        clinical studies published in peer reviewed journals that encompass over 8000 participants, both adults and children
                        to assess safety and efficacy. Of these clinical trials, over 80% have found clinically significant efficacy for
                        SB when supplemented for various conditions.<sup>1</sup>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        SB is an anaerobic yeast which is absent from the natural gut microbiota and does not permanently colonise
                        the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) after supplementation. SB will achieve a steady-state concentration in the
                        large bowel after 3 days of supplementation and is not detected in faeces within one week after discontinuing.
                        It is stable at room temperature 24&deg;C but thrives at 37&deg;C i.e. body temperature and has a high tolerance to
                        low pH and bile acids.<sup>1,2</sup> Furthermore, another advantage of SB as a probiotic yeast is that it is antibiotic
                        resistant due to being a fungi and also they do not exchange DNA with bacteria.<sup>2</sup> SB can therefore be supplemented
                        simultaneously with antibiotic therapy and assist with managing symptoms such as antibiotic associated diarrhoea.
                        The predominant therapeutic effect of SB is associated with treating diarrhoea due to various causes, including
                        antibiotic, infectious including <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, viral and parasitic, travelers diarrrhoea and diarrhoea
                        induced by inflammatory GIT conditions.

                    <p>
                        Extensive clinical studies have assessed the efficacy of SB in treating diarrhoea due to infectious causes.
                        A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that SB significantly reduced the duration of diarrhoea
                        due to acute infection by approximately 24 hours and that of hospitalization by up to 20 hours.<sup>3</sup> The authors
                        assessed 381 articles and 19 clinical trials with 17 of the studies performed in children from 3 months and older.
                        The dose of SB varied between 250 and 750 mg. From an evidence-based recommendation, the World Gastroenterology
                        Organization states that SB is not only useful in reducing the severity and duration (approximately 1 day) of acute
                        infectious diarrhoea in children, but is also safe.<sup>3</sup> Furthermore, SB supports regeneration of the intestinal commensal
                        bacterial cohort after episodes of diarrhoea such as increasing SCFA-producing bacteria, <em>Bacteroides</em> and
                        <em>Prevotella</em> genera.<sup>2</sup>

                        <li>
                            <strong><em>Clostridium difficile infection and associated diarrhoea</em></strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <em>Clostridium difficile</em> infection is strongly associated with antibiotic use, particularly in the hospital
                        setting but is also prevalent in the community setting. A recent Cochrane review reported that by co-prescribing
                        probioticâ€™s, importantly including SB, with antibiotics reduces the risk of contracting <em>C. difficile</em> infection by
                        up to 64% than when compared to that of a placebo.<sup>4</sup> It has been demonstrated that SB directly degrades <em>C.
                            difficile</em> toxin A and B via its release of protease enzymes. Further SB stimulates sIgA release in the intestine
                        regulating host immune responses and also is associated with higher serum IgG levels to <em>C. difficile
                            toxins</em> A and B.<sup>1</sup>

                            <strong><em>Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD)</em></strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        AAD can occur within a few hours after administering antibiotics for up to several months after ceasing treatment.
                        The prevalence of AAD varies from 5% to 30% in paediatrics and as high as 80% in very young hospitalized children.
                        In adults the prevalence ranges from 5% to 70%.<sup>5</sup> As SB is a yeast it is not affected by antibiotics. Furthermore,
                        when co-prescribed, SB promotes the re-establishment of a normal commensal microbial cohort at a faster rate than
                        when antibiotics are prescribed without SB.<sup>1,2</sup>

                        A number of studies have been conducted assessing the efficacy of SB in treating the symptoms of IBS.
                        A recent study demonstrated that supplementing IBS-diarrhoea dominant patients with SB (200 mg t.i.d. for 30 days)
                        alone or together with mesalazine (anti-inflammatory drug) significantly reduced symptom scores of stool frequency,
                        stool form and consistency, abdominal pain and bloating (p < 0.003).<sup>6</sup> Other studies have also shown that SB
                        (750 mg - 1000 mg per day for 4-6 weeks) significantly decreases pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves
                        quality of life (QoL) in IBS-D patients.<sup>7,8</sup>

                    <p>
                        Research has shown that SB regulates host immune responses by acting as an immune stimulant or by reducing
                        inflammatory cytokines. SB stimulates the release of sIgA in the intestine which targets pathogenic bacteria
                        present; it is associated with increased serum IgG to C. <em>difficile</em> toxins and interferes with NF-&kappa;B signaling.
                        SB is able to promote SCFA synthesis; restore fluid transport pathways within the intestine i.e. the sodium-glucose
                        transporter which is important for rehydration during diarrhoea and vomiting; preserve tight junction integrity;
                        stimulate protein and energy production and aid in enterocyte maturation via stimulating the release of spermine and
                        spermidine or other brush border enzymes. SB is also capable in preventing the growth of <em>Candida albicans</em> and other
                        pathogens such as <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Yersinia</em>.<sup>1,2</sup>
