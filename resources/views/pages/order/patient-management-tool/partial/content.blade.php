                    <p>
                        All products at Medlab are niched, have clinical relevance and are specific to certain areas
                        of health. With this in mind, we have developed a Patient Management Tool (PMT) allowing
                        practitioners to recommend and tailor a regime to meet their patients health needs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using the Medlab website, practitioners are able to view a wide range of products, both from
                        Medlab as well as most other nutraceutical companies. Hence clinicians can reference products
                        that would be most useful to their patients and/or for themselves.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Using the PMT, clinicians are able to recommend dosage about products they are prescribing,
                        as well as any orders they have placed for Medlab's products, through the Medlab website.
                        Clinicians may assign certain products to patients using the PMT and allocate product pricing
                        for certain patients.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The PMT is also useful to prescribe products to a patient. Clinicians can view when they
                        issued a prescription and what date a repeat prescription should be written if they are taken
                        in accordance with the clinicians advice. This allows the clinician to be certain their
                        patients are utilizing products to their set guidelines.
