                        Price shall be the amount stated on the emailed quote or invoice issued. The purchaser shall

                    <p>
                        Private patients being treated by a practitioner may be given a patient code to be entered
                        upon checkout, which gives a discount on all products. This code must not be provided to any
                        patient or member of the public via broadcast e-mail, must not be shown on any website and
                        must not be made available to anyone other than the practitioners' private patients.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If a practitioner is found to have e-mailed the code to an e-mail database that includes
                        anyone other than private patients, the option to discount to private patients via an online
                        website will be revoked.

                        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Note:</span> To verify that a discount code was
                        successfully applied, review your Invoice on your confirmation e-mail or log into your account
                        and view your purchase history.

                        If the total cost of the items you are purchasing exceeds the discount amount, you will be
                        prompted on the checkout page to provide your credit card information for the remaining
                        balance.

                    <p>
                        If you cancel or return items purchased using a discount code, the value of the promotion
                        won't be returned to you.
