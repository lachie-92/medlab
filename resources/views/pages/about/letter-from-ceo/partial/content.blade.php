                        Here at Medlab, we believe in innovation and collaboration; a place that welcomes challenges
                        and embraces the risks of biotech.  Specifically, our cultural belief is represented in our
                        mantra: innovating and redefining medicines.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        With my stewardship at
                        <a class="medlab_panel_content_link" href="http://www.bioceuticals.com.au/">FIT-BioCeuticals</a>
                        and over 25 years experience within nutraceutical sales and development, as well as early drug discovery in Australia, Asia and the USA, it was a natural progression to pioneer research that focuses on developing new biological therapeutics and creating "first in-class" drugs. For us, this biological research is both exciting and intriguing; a relatively new field that ensues risks but generates great rewards.  It is the excitement of developing a new, safe and clinically efficacious drug that brings the Medlab family together.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        Today, Medlab embraces a unique area of research to develop new medicines in highly sort areas;
                        specifically, chronic kidney disease, obesity, depression, pain management and
                        anti-aging/muscular-skeletal health.  The focus on these specific areas of research is based
                        on our strong belief that biological medicine plays a huge role in rescuing and/or improving
                        symptomatology. All research needs support, so we therefore encourage you to sign up to our
                        patient billing and patient management tool as a healthcare practitioner. By purchasing our
                        products you will enable us to effectively and efficiently perform clinical trials with this
                        research enabling the development of new medicines in a much-needed space.
