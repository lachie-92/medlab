                        Rachel Manuel completed a PhD in 2013 from the University of Claude Bernard, Lyon (France).
                        She examined the implication of a collagen-derived fragment in tumour growth and angiogenesis
                        regulation. Her present research work at Medlab focuses on the in vitro effects of probiotic
                        strains. The purpose of this research is to examine their ability to restore the integrity of
                        the gut epithelial barrier, which is impaired in patients with chronic kidney disease.
