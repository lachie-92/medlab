                    All tissues have a requisite for uridine. Uridine is an important nucleoside precursor in the
                    pyrimidine salvage pathway.<sup>8,9,10</sup> Except for erythrocytes and the liver and kidney, which maintain
                    de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and supply other tissues with uridine for salvage, most normal
                    tissues in adults rely on the salvage of uridine from plasma.<sup>9</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Uridine also participates in the regulation of several physiological and pathological
                    processes.<sup>11</sup> In the absence of sugar, uridine can serve as an essential precursor for both
                    carbohydrate metabolism and nucleic acid synthesis. Besides the direct salvage to pyrimidine
                    nucleotides, the ribose moiety produced by the phosphorolysis of uridine can either enter the
                    pentose cycle to meet cellular energy requirements or form phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, which
                    is used in the biosynthesis of purine nucleotides.11 In the nervous system, uridine acts as a
                    physiological regulator of sleep function and demonstrates the ability to maintain brain metabolism
                    during ischemia and severe hypoglycemia.

                    Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a compound that is naturally found intracellularly and bound to organelle
                    membranes such as for example the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and golgi apparatus.
                    CoQ10 is found with the highest concentrations in tissues such as the heart, liver, kidneys, and
                    pancreas. This compound is intricate to the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
                    ATP is essential to all bodily functions, including the generation of energy and a multitude of
                    metabolic functions.<sup>12,13,14</sup>

                    Over the past several decades, research has seen a refocus towards thinking and efforts directed
                    in elucidating the critical inter–relationships that exist between the GIT microbiome and its host.
                    This research has redefined the interactions between gut microbes and vertebrates, now recognising
                    that the microbial active cohort and its mammalian host have shared co–evolutionary metabolic
                    interactions that span millennia. Microbial interactions in the GIT provide the necessary cues for
                    the development of regulated pro– and anti–inflammatory signals that promotes immunological
                    tolerance, metabolic regulation and other factors which may then control local and extra–intestinal
                    inflammation.<sup>15</sup> Furthermore, it is also becoming apparent that the GIT with its commensal cohort is
                    a central regulator for the activities of end organs such as the kidneys, brain, adipose tissue,
                    muscle and liver and as such may provide local prompts that are transmitted extra–intestinally to
                    end organ sites.  A scientific insight therefore has emerged that plausibly links the GIT with the
                    physiology of end organ function that may influence health maintenance or trigger and support a
                    disease state. Maintaining a healthy GIT milieu and epithelium with the administration of
                    probiotics may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for health.

                    Probiotics are those live bacterial cultures that are added to foods (e.g., yoghurts) and employed
                    as dietary supplements, that when orally administered can improve the health of the host beyond
                    their fundamental basic nutritional content.<sup>16</sup> Probiotic bacteria encompass those from different
                    genera (as for example Lactobacilli, Bifidobacterium, Escherichia, Saccharomyces
                    (a yeast), Streptococcus) giving rise to a variety of different species of each genera
                    (i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus; Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus); that lead to
                    different strains within a species (i.e., Lactobacillus acidophilus La–1, Lactobacillus acidophilus
                    NCFM). This taxonomic differentiation, importantly emphasizing that different strains from the same
                    bacterial species can be different and may elaborate different physiological functions within the
                    GIT<sup>17</sup> whilst exhibiting overlapping or specific therapeutic actions to different organ systems.<sup>18</sup>
