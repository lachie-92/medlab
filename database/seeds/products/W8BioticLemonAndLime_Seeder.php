                    W8Biotic&trade; contains Hi-Maize Resistance Starch, which is a Type 2 Resistant Starch (RS2) with
                    therapeutic properties that may help to increase satiety and assist with weight management.
                    Hi-Maize is also a prebiotic and produces short-chain fatty acids that help to support healthy
                    gastrointestinal function. Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that assists in the metabolic
                    regulation of healthy blood glucose levels and in supporting skeletal muscle protein synthesis in
                    healthy individuals. W8Biotic&trade; also contains Lactobacillus plantarum (Med 25) and Lactobacillus
                    paracasei (Med 24) that naturally synthesise alpha-hydroxy isocaproic acid (HICA) from leucine,
                    which is indicated to support lean muscle mass in healthy individuals. Furthermore, L-carnitine
                    assists with modulating energy expenditure in healthy individuals.

                    A significant body of research has been conducted demonstrating digestive and colonic health
                    benefits of High Amylose Maize Starch (HAMS) with research also showing metabolic advantages.<sup>1</sup>
                    Resistant starch is the total amount of starch, and the products of starch degradation that
                    resists digestion in the small intestine. Hi-Maize demonstrates numerous health benefits
                    such as increasing satiety and helping with weight control, assisting with glycaemic
                    management and promoting digestive health. Hi-Maize demonstrates increased satiety compared
                    to other forms of fibre helping people to feel fuller in the hours after consuming it<sup>2</sup> and
                    has also shown to help people eat less after 2 hours<sup>3</sup> as well over the proceeding 24 hours.<sup>4</sup>
                    Hi-Maize consumption has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity in healthy people,<sup>5,6</sup>
                    in people with type 2 diabetes<sup>7</sup> and in individuals with insulin resistance.<sup>8-10</sup> Furthermore,
                    as a prebiotic, Hi-Maize supports beneficial bacterial growth and activity, increasing
                    short-chain fatty acid production and  assisting with normal intestinal function.<sup>11-13</sup>

                    Leucine has a unique role in metabolic regulation beyond the fundamental role of being an
                    amino acid, a substrate for the synthesis of proteins. Leucine has a direct link to the
                    maintenance of glucose homeostasis by enhancing the recycling of glucose via the glucose-alanine
                    cycle and stimulates muscle protein synthesis through the insulin-signaling cascade during
                    catabolic periods such as fasting or energy restriction.<sup>14,15</sup> Further, leucine supplementation
                    stimulates recovery of muscle protein synthesis after exercise. The mechanisms of leucine
                    appear to contribute to a metabolic advantage during weight loss.<sup>15</sup> Acetyl-L-Carnitine is
                    crucial for beta-oxidation, facilitating the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the
                    mitochondrial membrane for oxidation. When combined with weight loss motivation, the beneficial
                    effects of L-Carnitine are amplified including significant body weight loss and a decrement of
                    serum triglyceride levels when compared to participants supplementing with L-Carnitine but
                    being assigned to a non-motived group for weight loss.<sup>16</sup> DL-α-hydroxy isocaproic acid (HICA)
                    is an end product of leucine metabolism in human tissues such as muscle and connective tissue
                    and is considered an anti-catabolic substance. HICA has demonstrated to increase whole lean
                    body mass in healthy athletes and also decreased whole body delayed-onset muscle soreness
                    (DOMS) symptoms.<sup>17</sup> The Medlab Lactobacilli plantarum (Med 25) and Lactobacillus paracasei
                    (Med 24) have demonstrated the highest production of HICA when co-cultured with leucine.
