                    Clinical evidence has shown that a combination of Omega-3 Fatty Acids and Plant Sterols reduces
                    serum LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, inducing shifts in the lipoprotein distribution
                    that may provide additional cardiovascular benefits than either nutrient taken alone.
                    Omega-3 essential Fatty Acids stabilise the electrical activity of cardiac myocytes, support
                    membrane fluidity and integrity of blood vessels.  Combined with Plant Sterols this formulation
                    helps maintain healthy blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels in healthy individuals.

                    <strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids and the Cardiovascular System</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Important fats that enhance the functional physiology of the cardiovascular system are
                    alpha–linolenic acid (ALA), the parent compound of the omega–3 fatty acid family, and
                    linoleic acid (LA), the parent compound of the omega–6 family. ALA and LA are essential
                    fatty acids obtained from the diet, as they cannot be synthesised. Omega–3 fatty acids
                    consist of the long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
                    and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) that are of marine origin with oily fish being the richest
                    dietary source.<sup>1</sup>Omega-3 fatty acids have important physiological properties that
                    include anti-inflammatory, antiarrhythmic and antithrombotic properties.<sup>2</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Numerous reviews have summarised the cardiovascular benefits of fish and fish oil consumption
                    in the primary<sup>3</sup> and secondary<sup>4</sup> prevention of cardiovascular conditions.
                    Research on nutrient intakes has shown that regular consumption of omega-3 fats significantly
                    lowers heart-disease risk.<sup>3,4</sup> For example, a report of a cohort from the Nurses
                    Health Study<sup>5</sup> showed that women who ate two-to-four servings of fish a week
                    reduced heart disease risk by 30 per cent. Further, it has been shown that omega–3s reduce
                    blood pressure and heart rate, lower blood triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, and
                    make blood less likely to form clots and create life-threatening thromboses.<sup>5</sup>

                    <strong>Plant Sterols for Healthy Blood Cholesterol and Triglyceride Support</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Plant sterols were first described for their cholesterol lowering effects in the 1950’s, when they
                    were isolated from vegetable fats/oils and pine trees and were chemically analyzed for their
                    effectiveness. Plant sterol and stanols can lower blood cholesterol by decreasing intestinal
                    absorption of cholesterol. Given that sterols and stanols structurally resemble cholesterol,
                    they interfere with micellar solubilisation of dietary and biliary cholesterol present in the
                    intestinal lumen and therefore less cholesterol is absorbed into the systemic circulation.
                    <sup>6-8</sup> Besides lowering serum LDL-C concentrations, it has been shown that plant sterol
                    and stanol esters lower serum TAG levels, particularly in subjects with the metabolic syndrome
                    who are characterized by elevated TAG concentrations. The mechanism of lowering TAGs has
                    theoretically been proposed to be due to either acting on enhanced clearance from the circulation
                    or decreased TAG appearance in the circulation.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, murine studies have shown
                    that plant sterols and stanols can protect against a high fat, high cholesterol diet-induced
                    non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – liver inflammation but not from liver fatty acid
                    accumulation. <sup>10</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A meta-analysis of 41 trials concluded that on average, an intake of 1.5-2.0 g/day of stanol and
                    sterols decreased LDL-C by 10%.<sup>11</sup> An additional study of 59 clinical studies concluded
                    that plant sterol containing products reduced LDL concentrations but the reduction was related to
                    individuals\' baseline LDL levels, food carrier, and frequency and time of intake.<sup>12</sup>
                    Both studies similarly concluded that ingesting greater than 2.5 grams per day of plant sterols
                    and stanols did not add any greater benefits of lowering a greater percentage of blood cholesterol.

                <p>
                    A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel efficacy study investigated the
                    dose-response relation between a low dose (&lt;2 g/d) of EPA + DHA from fish oil combined with
                    plant sterols and the affect on serum TAGs and LDL-C levels.<sup>13</sup>A total of 247
                    participants were included in the study and randomised to either the control group or 1 of 4
                    interventions containing a fixed amount of plant sterols (2.5 g/d) and varying amounts of EPA +
                    DHA (0-1.8 g/d) for 4 weeks. The authors reported that a combination of EPA + DHA from fish oil
                    and plant sterols decreases serum TAGs concentrations in a dose-dependent manner (9-16%) while
                    also decreasing LDL-C concentrations (≈ 13%) in a population with elevated cholesterol but normal
                    TAG levels.<sup>13</sup>
