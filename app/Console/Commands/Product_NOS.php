                    <strong>L-Arginine</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    L-arginine is a semi-essential amino acid with numerous metabolic roles within the body. It is a building block for proteins
                    (hormones, histones, collagen and intra-cellular structural proteins) and the synthesis of creatine – the high-phosphate energy
                    stores in cells. L-arginine is the precursor to nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, an important cellular signaling molecule involved
                    in many physiological processes and is most well known as a powerful vasodilator of blood vessels that regulates
                    blood flow (see Figure 1). NO also has anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and anti-viral activity, playing an important role in
                    immunological function.<sup>1-3</sup> Endothelium-derived NO causes vasorelaxation and inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation, thus
                    maintaining blood fluidity and preventing thrombosis.<sup>4,5</sup> Platelets also produce NO that inhibits platelet aggregation, adhesion to
                    vascular endothelium, recruitment to growing thrombi and the formation of leukocyte-platelet aggregates.
                    Endothelial dysfunction is a common trait of essentially all cardiovascular risk factors. Impaired NO-mediated endothelial function
                    is characteristic of cardiovascular diseases, correlates with risk factor profiles and is an independent predictor of adverse cardiac
                    events.<sup>3</sup> Ageing is associated with an increase in atherothrombotic conditions, including. hypertension, and it has been suggested
                    that there is an age-related decline in nitric oxide (NO) production in arterial endothelium and platelets. It has been reported that exogenous
                    administration of L-arginine restores NO bioavailability.<sup>3</sup>

                    <strong>Creatine</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Extensive research has been conducted on the ergogenic effects of creatine on improving physical and cognitive
                    performance and increasing fat free mass, however the exact mechanisms are not clear.<sup>7</sup> Creatine increases cellular
                    phosphocreatine content and together act as an intracellular buffer for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and also as an
                    energy shuttle for the movement of high-energy phosphates from mitochondrial sites of production to cytoplasmic sites
                    of utilisation in a variety of cells and creatine must be continuously replenished (see Figure 2).<sup>8</sup>
                    Creatine can be synthesised in the body from arginine and glycine, but muscle cells cannot synthesise creatine and so
                    depend on the uptake from the circulation which can further be promoted by exercise.<sup>7,8</sup> Creatine is particularly found
                    in cells with high and fluctuating energy demands, such as skeletal muscle and the heart.<sup>9</sup> The ergogenic affects of
                    creatine are evident for high-intensity exercise of short duration and has been shown to increase muscle mass when
                    combined with an exercise program.<sup>7,9</sup>

                    <strong>Beta-Alanine</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Beta-alanine is a non-essential amino acid and the rate-limiting precursor to carnosine synthesis in muscle cells,
                    an important physiological buffer that readily accepts protons during contraction-induced acidosis. Supplementation
                    of beta-alanine is required to achieve the active daily dose required to significantly elevate intramuscular carnosine
                    and it increases dose-dependently. Increasing muscle carnosine concentration may improve athletic performance in exercise
                    tasks that accrue a high level of muscle acidosis, improving high-intensity intermittent exercise performance and time to fatigue.
                    Carnosine is also involved in maintaining ATP stores in muscle cells and skeletal muscle cell contraction.<sup>11,12</sup>
                    When combined with creatine, there is an additive effect on reducing fatigue and training intensity.<sup>12</sup>

                    <strong>Tyrosine and Vitamins</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tyrosine is the amino acid precursor to the synthesis of neurotransmitters involved in cognitive performance and stress resistance;
                    namely dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. Tyrosine may aid in mental activity and in improving cognitive performance under
                    stressful conditions due to its direct role in increasing catecholamine synthesis in the brain.<sup>13</sup> The B vitamins are involved in
                    the transformation of dietary energy sources such as carbohydrates, fats and proteins into cellular energy in the form of ATP,
                    functioning as cofactors and coenzymes for numerous enzymatic reactions. Vitamin C is required for the synthesis of catecholamine
                    hormones, dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline.<sup>14</sup>

                    <strong>Guarana Seed Powder</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Caffeine is widely used as an enhancement for athletic performance via its broad range of metabolic, hormonal and physiologic effects.
                    Guarana is a natural source of caffeine. Caffeine has been shown to enhance exercise performance and reduce time to exhaustion.
                    Mechanisms include stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, increase intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and spare
                    glycogen via increasing lipolysis.<sup>15</sup> Furthermore, caffeine affects cognition, mood and alertness via binding to adenosine
                    receptors in the brain. Adenosine, a neuromodulator, binds to adenosine receptors and slows nerve cell activity, whereas caffeine
                    blocks adenosine receptors and speeds up the activity of cells.<sup>15,16</sup> Research has demonstrated that small to moderate doses
                    (i.e. 3 – 6 mg•kg-1) of caffeine has superior ergogenic effectiveness than higher doses (9 mg•kg-1) and also reduces any negative side-effects.<sup>15</sup>
